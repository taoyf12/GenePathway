# GenePathway

## Connected pathway graph
* SGA sets: 9,829(?) Might use that in train datasets.
* DEG sets: 5,776(?) Might use that in train datasets.
* SGA & DEG: 2,487
* Nodes(SGA | DEG): 13,118
* Directed edges(TDI pairs) = 1,496,128

## Raw dataset
* SGA sets (not all of them appear in TDI pairs): 19,732
* DEG sets (not all of them appear in TDI pairs): 19,515
* SGA & DEG: 15,252
* Nodes(SGA | DEG): 23,995
* Directed edges(TDI pairs, same path in different patients count as different ones): 16,750,423
