# ProPPR Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to be at least three of the following: 

1.  small, so you can run them on a laptop; 
1.  human-readable/type-able, so you could conceivably type out all the commands; 
1.  representative of how ProPPR is actually used;
1.  interesting, or showing somewhat of the breadth of problems ProPPR can solve.

Each tutorial (should) have its own README discussing the problem and how to run it.

## Tutorial index:

1. `textcat` - text categorization
2. `labelProp` - label propagation and SSL
3. `structureLearning` - using the pageRank gradient to select new rule candidates
4. ??
