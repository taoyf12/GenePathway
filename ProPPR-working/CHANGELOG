New in 2.0
==========

WAM-based prover and graph architecture
* 73x grounding speedup in python
* 8-10x grounding speedup in java

Multi-goal queries
* e.g. disambiguate(bethlehem,EntityId),entityType(EntityId,Type)	+disambiguate(bethlehem,e12345),entityType(e12345,city)

Query-centric solutions:
* Prover output for "predict(doc1,Y)" is "predict(doc1,cats)" instead of "-1=c[cats]" 

Name changes
* Cook -> Ground (ExampleCooker -> Grounder, *.cooked -> *.grounded, etc)
* edu.cmu.ml.praprolog -> edu.cmu.ml.proppr

Examples organization
* inference and learning examples now in edu.cmu.ml.proppr.examples

Graph organization
* inference and learning graphs now coded separately in edu.cmu.ml.proppr.graph

Directory structure
* src/java/main - primary java source
* src/java/test - unit tests
* src/testcases - supporting files for unit tests
* src/scripts   - built-in scripts (program compiler, structure learner, etc)
* scripts       - analysis tools (negative label sampling, answer metrics, grounded file statistics, etc)

The following features haven't been ported yet:
* SparseGraph
* FindGradient

The following features are no longer supported (though we can bring them back by request):
* Prompt
* neo4j
* tuprolog
